- using the browscap.org recommended Browscap PHP library (installed using
  the composer utility), instead of the default get_browser_info() call. This
  was done to avoid getting many "Unexpected..." errors in Apache's error.log
--- Install by cd'ing to /usr/share/compoer, then running "composer require         browscap/browscap-php"
--- Need to update cache to a directory accessible to OS user www-data. I ran
    the following command to do this:
 
      sudo -u www-data vendor/bin/browscap-php browscap:update --cache /var/www/php/

    This command grabs the latest browscap.ini and converts it into a format
    usable by PHP.

    Note that '/var/www/php' is accessible to www-data, but another directory
    that it can access would also work.

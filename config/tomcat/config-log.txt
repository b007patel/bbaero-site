- added /etc/tomcat7/userenv.bp to set some environment variables for
  tomcat
-- export DISPLAY=:99 so that headless Selenium testing can run using
  the backgrounded Xvfb instance
-- support for adding JVM options as needed (e.g., "-verbose:class")
- occasionally (usually whenever template/php/* are modified), the following
  set of commands must be run to refresh /var/www/testlogs/runtest.html:
--- cd ~/gitrepo/bbaero-site/web
--- ./change_tmpls.sh
--- sudo -u tomcat7 cp runtest.html /var/www/testlogs/
--- I have run this already, so it does not need to be run again...yet

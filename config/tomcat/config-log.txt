- added /etc/tomcat7/userenv.bp to set some environment variables for
  tomcat
-- export DISPLAY=:99 so that headless Selenium testing can run using
  the backgrounded Xvfb instance
-- support for adding JVM options as needed (e.g., "-verbose:class")

- occasionally (usually whenever template/php/* are modified), the following
  set of commands must be run to refresh /var/www/testlogs/runtest.html:
--- cd ~/gitrepo/bbaero-site/web
--- ./change_tmpls.sh
--- sudo -u tomcat7 cp runtest.html /var/www/testlogs/
--- I have run this already, so it does not need to be run again...yet

Sept 12, 2016
- made changes to support MySQL connection pooling
--- added a JDBC resource ChemTestDB as a datasource (i.e., connection pool)
  in Tomcat's main context.xml, /var/lib/tomcat7/conf/context.xml:

  <Resource name="jdbc/ChemTestDB" auth="Container" type="javax.sql.DataSource"
               maxActive="30" maxIdle="10" maxWait="10000"
               username="root" password="admin" driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
               url="jdbc:mysql://localhost/chemtest"/>

--- in order for the pool to start OK, needed to add mysql-connector...jar to
   /usr/share/java, then make a symlink to it in /usr/share/tomcat/lib

- added support for Tomcat JVM to start a local Java debugger (jdb) listener
--- support for adding JVM options BEFORE existing options (needed for starting
  local JDB listener)
--- added new environment variable to /etc/tomcat7/userenv.bp for the new JVM
  options for local JDB support

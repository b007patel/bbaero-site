[Aug 08, 2017]
- some time in 2017 bbaero was upgraded to Ubuntu 16.0.4 LTS. The Apache server
  was changed to Apache 2.4.18, since that is what Ubuntu 16.0.4 LTS has.
- its configuration was updated, if needed, by the apache2 package install
- set up Ubuntu 16.0.4 on a laptop. Here were the Apache setup steps
--- installed Apache 2.4.18 (package name apache2)
--- installed PHP 7.0 (package name php)
--- installed modjk (package names libapache2-mod-jk, libapache-mod-jk-doc)
--- summary of differences between default mods-available/jk.conf and
    bbaero's file:

--- note that the certificate differences were NOT made on the laptop because
  the certificates are only valid for bbaero.freeddns.org
--- changed php-fpm's port to 19000 (search this file for '19000' for change
    steps)
--- matched mods-enabled on laptop to be the same as bbaero's mods-enabled
----- removed mpm_event.* symlinks, replaced with mpm_prefork.* symlinks
----- added the following symlinks:
   -- proxy.conf
   -- proxy_fcgi.conf
   -- proxy.load
   -- rewrite.load
   -- socache_shmcb.load
   -- ssl.conf
   -- ssl.load
--- matched conf-enabled on laptop to be the same as bbaero's conf-enabled
   -- copied conf-available/javascript-common.conf from bbaero to laptop.
   -- made conf-enabled/javascript-common.conf symlink to enable it
   -- copied conf-available/workers.properties from bbaero to laptop.
   -- made conf-enabled/workers.properties symlink to enable it
 
[Sept 17, 2016]
- At this time it seems likes too much hassle to upgrade to Ubuntu 16.0.4 LTS
 (Xenial Xerus)
- To support "Options Indexes" and proxy_fcgi at the same time, though, upgraded
 Apache from 2.4.7 to 2.4.23:
    # Install Apache packages from a PPA by Ondřej Surý's.
    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ondrej/apache2
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install apache2

- made minor changes to a few config files, as suggested by the new defaults
- after upgrading to Apache 2.4.23 made the following changes to support
  testlog dir listing, while banning other listings
--- the following new/revised source files are needed for these changes to work
  properly:
    - web/js/index.js
    - web/css/index.css
    - web/error.php
--- after "HeaderName" directive in mods-enables/autoindex.conf, added
    # BP include Javascript to reveal page when dir listing available
    IndexHeadInsert "<script src=\"/js/index.js\"></script>"

--- also in autoindex.conf, replaced
    IndexIgnore .??* *~ *# RCS CVS *,v *,t

   with
    # BP suppress directory listings
    #IndexIgnore .??* *~ *# RCS CVS *,v *,t
    IndexIgnore *
    IndexStyleSheet "/css/index.css"

    # BP allow directory listing only for testlogs
    <Directory /var/www/testlogs>
            DirectoryIndex disabled
            Options +Indexes
            IndexIgnoreReset ON
            AllowOverride None
    </Directory>

--- in sites-enabled/default_ssl.conf, removed the ProxyPassMatch line below
  the "added to forward PHP ..." comment with
    # BP - added to forward PHP requests to PHP-FPM server
    <FilesMatch \.phps$>
          SetHandler application/x-httpd-php-source
    </FilesMatch>
    <FilesMatch \.php$>
             SetHandler "proxy:fcgi://127.0.0.1:19000"
    </FilesMatch>


[Sept 4, 2016]
-- enabled PHP-FPM, disabled per-process mod_php
-- performance is much quicker
- removed php.load/.conf symlinks (SLs) from mods-enabled
- added proxy.load/.conf and proxy_fcgi SLs to mods-enabled
- added a ProxyPass directive in sites-enabled/default_ssl.conf to tell
  Apache to forward php's to php5-fpm
    # from https://wiki.mikejung.biz/Php-fpm accessed on 2016-09-04
    ProxyPassMatch ^/(.*.php(/.*)?)$ fcgi://127.0.0.1:19000/var/www/$1

- installed php5-fpm package
- changed php5-fpm's default port to 19000 by changing a line in
  /etc/php/7.0/fpm/pool.d/www.conf. Changed

    listen = /run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock

  to

    ; BP - commenting out default file socket listener, adding localhost listener
    ;listen = /run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock
    listen = 127.0.0.1:19000

[Oct 16, 2016]
- after installing Xenial Xerus (Ubuntu LTS 16.04.1) I decided to use their
  apache2 version (2.4.18) instead of Ondrej Sury's 2.4.23.
- after installing it, I got an error:
    Unit apache2.service is masked.
- solution was to rm -rf the following two directories. This allowed for them
  to be recreated properly.
    - /etc/systemd/system/apache2.service
    - /etc/systemd/system/apache-htcacheclean.service

[Sept 5, 2016]
-- installed mod_jk shared library off the web somewhere
-- added modjk.load/conf and modjk SLs to mods-enabled
-- added the following to sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf:

    # BP - for jk to work OK to send reqs to Tomcat
    JkMount /chemtestpage/TestRunner|/* balancer
    JkMount /chemtestpage/test.jsp balancer

[Oct 9, 2016]
-- must update JkMount entries for every new servlet added to Tomcat
-- added the following line (with >> for emphasis) to
   sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf:

    # BP - for jk to work OK to send reqs to Tomcat
    JkMount /chemtestpage/TestRunner|/* balancer
    JkMount /chemtestpage/TRRequest|/* balancer
    JkMount /chemtestpage/test.jsp balancer
